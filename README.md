# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to help fictional company Pewlett Hackard plan and prepare for a mass exodus of employees. With baby boomers reaching retirement age, the company wanted to know how many employees would be leaving the company in the new few years. This would allow them to plan ahead for hiring, training, and mentorship to fill these roles within the company.

SQL was utilized to create tables in which to visualize the data.

## Results:
	- A total of 33,118 employees are reaching the retirement age in the coming years.
	- There are 5 managers retiring. The company will want to start making plans for those positions as soon as possible (promoting from within, hiring from outside the company, etc).
	- The follow number of people is reaching retirement age in each department
		* 9,281 from Development
		* 8,174 from Production
		* 5,860 from Sales
		* 2,597 from Research
		* 2,413 from Customer Service
		* 2,234 from Quality Management
		* 2,199 from Marketing
		* 1,953 from Human Resources
		* 1,908 from Finance

## Summary: 
	- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
		* 33,118 employees will be retiring in the "silver tsunami". The employees will reach retirement age over the course of a few years, so not all positions will need to be filled at once.

	- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
		* The total number of mentoring eligible employees is 1,549. Although this is not nearly as many employees as will be retiring, it is entirely possible that these will be a sufficient number of mentors. It is possible that these employees could mentor multiple new hires at a time (especially because the "silver tsunami" will take place over the course of a few years time and not in one fell swoop). It would mean that over the course of a few years, each of these individuals would need to mentor 25 new employees.
		* Additionally, the members of the "silver tsunami" have not yet retired, so in theory, they could begin the mentorship process with existing employees. This would ensure that the next generation below the mentor-ready employees could potentially take up that position as well.

	- Are there enough mentors in each department to mentor incoming employees?
		* Based off the table below, each department does have employees that are mentor-ready, but the ratio of mentors to new employees does vary some from department to department.

	- Are salaries a discrepancy in this company?
		* It appears that there are many employees of retirement age still making low salaries. It would be something for the company to take a closer look at and perhaps make edits to.
